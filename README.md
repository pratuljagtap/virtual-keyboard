## 🧠 How It Works (Behind the Magic)

1. **MediaPipe** detects your hand and finds your **index fingertip**
2. **OpenCV** draws a virtual keyboard on your webcam feed
3. When you **bend your finger**, it simulates a keypress
4. **PyAutoGUI** sends that keypress to **whatever app is focused**
5. Your typed text appears **live on screen** for feedback

It’s like your hand becomes a **laser pointer + mouse + keyboard** — all in one! 🖐️➡️⌨️
